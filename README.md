TimesFM_Forecasting_Comparison_Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that compares time series forecasting performance between Google's TimesFM model and Nixtla's forecasting models. The objective of this project is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model in forecasting accuracy, speed, and scalability.

Project Overview
Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. With the advent of advanced machine learning models, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models compare against traditional and newer approaches.

In this notebook, we:

Load and preprocess time series data.
Implement and train Nixtla's forecasting models.
Implement and train Google's TimesFM model.
Compare the performance of the models on key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and training time.
Visualize the forecast results for a better understanding of each model's predictions.
Models Compared
Nixtla's Forecasting Models:

A collection of state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms optimized for efficiency and accuracy.
Includes models like ARIMA, Prophet, and others.
Google's TimesFM Model:

A cutting-edge transformer-based model designed by Google for time series forecasting.
Focuses on leveraging patch-based transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies.
Key Features
Easy-to-follow Notebook: The notebook is structured to guide you step-by-step through the comparison process.
Comprehensive Evaluation: Detailed comparison of model performance across various time series datasets.
Interactive Visualizations: Graphs and plots to help interpret the forecasting results.
